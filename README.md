# A-Frame Hello World

A Hello World experiment so I could try out WebVR.

*  code based on [A-Frame Boilerplate](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/)
*  360 of my beach shot using [Google Street View](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/google-street-view/id904418768?mt=8) on iOS (WOW is that ever easy to use)
*  played with using a home-made [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/)
*  published on Github pages
